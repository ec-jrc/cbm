    "Even though we are working on optimizing the code, it can potentially run for a very long time, heavily depending on the size, but also other aspects of the input data. At the initial stages, the buckets should populate at a relativly high rate, with very visible changes to the progress widgets. However, in later stages of the analysis, some buckets can stay empty for a longer period of time, while the algorithm is looking for the right parcels to populate them with. It is not uncommon for most of the analysis to be completed very quickly, just for the last one or two small buckets to require most of the time to be filled.\n",
