Selecting one or more Holding Level interventions results in creating an additional output file, with the summary of all holdings related to the Holding Level interventions.\n",
    "* **Retain / filter out non-contributing parcels** - a new optional parameter that allows the user to decide if a highest-ranked parcel of a holding should be filtered out or retained, when all parcels of a recently completed bucket are filtered out from the parcel list.\n",

    "* Extraction ID - the user can now define a unique ID for each extraction. If a custom ID is not defined, the tool will automatically assign a randomized ID to simplify the distinction between output files generated for different extraction iterations.\n",
