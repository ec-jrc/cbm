It is an interactive document that allows you to combine executable code, text, images, and visualizations all in one easily accessible place. Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/).\n",

    "#### Other Prerequisites\n",

    "Once Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment are installed, please install the following Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IPython**: An enhanced interactive Python interpreter.\n",
    "* **ipywidgets**: Tools for creating interactive GUIs (sets of widgets) within Jupyter notebooks.\n",

This will run the code within that cell and display any outputs directly below it. The code included in the cells is intentionally kept very brief and simple - to have a closer look at the details behind the algorithm, you can open one of the Python files that the notebook imports from.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interactive Elements:** This notebook includes interactive widgets (like checkboxes, buttons, text boxes, and possibly more in the future) designed to make it easier for you to change parameters and interact with the data without needing to modify the code directly. We actually advise against changing anything in the code cells. The widgets are not displayed by default - they appear after running a code cell that implements them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sequential Execution:** It's important to run the cells in the order they appear. Some cells depend on code or data from earlier cells, so running them out of order might result in errors or incorrect outputs."
