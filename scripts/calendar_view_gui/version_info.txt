2021-09-27: Option added to read SCL histogram from the database through
            RESTful service, instead of downloading the SCL layers and
            calculating the histogram locally.
            Still: there is a possibility to force download of SCL layers 
            if we want to doulbe check the calculation of the SCL histogram.

2021-11-29: Some bug fixing so that it runs with the latest python and package
            versions.
