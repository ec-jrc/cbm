# Code examples for "CAP Checks by Monitoring‚Äù (CbM)
### European Commission, Joint Research Center

**This work is in progress and may be subject to frequent changes**

The European Commission promotes the use of new technologies in the context of
the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Integrated Administration and
Control Systems (IACS) which are managed by the European Union Member States.
In 2018, "Checks by Monitoring" (CbM) were introduced for area-based support
schemes. The EU  Paying Agencies (PA) who adapt CbM will migrate to the use of
Copernicus Sentinel data to check aid applications.



## Prerequisites

To start CbM it is essential to have:

1. Computing resources
2. Copernicus Analysis Ready Data (CARD)
3. Valid agricultural parcel data (FOI compliant)


## Deployment

There are several steps to set up the core components for Checks by Monitoring.
These steps require different types of technical expertise. 

- Install server applications
    - Docker (containerization system)
    - Postgres database with PostGIS extension
    - Jupyter (interactive analysis and visualization environment)


- Adding data to the database
    - Parcels data to database
    - CARD Metadata and other required data


- Running code examples
    - Parcel extraction routines
    - Machine learning algorithms
    - Database backups
    - Analytical routines (e.g. market detection)


- Accessing and viewing results
    - Building RESTFul API
    - Using Jupyter Notebooks


See the documentation at [jrc-cbm.readthedocs.io](https://jrc-cbm.readthedocs.io)
for more details and setup instructions.
