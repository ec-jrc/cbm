    """FOI assessment is based on spatial analysis of a “thematic” raster
    produced in advance.

    The thematic raster can be the result of a any image/raster processing
    method yielding a class label for each pixel - crop classification, behavior
    analysis of land phenomenon, gridded data on soil, slope, humidity, etc.
    The starting point was the idea that inside of an homgeneous parcel we
    should have only one type of pixel.
    For example if the thematic raster is the result of a crop classification,
    inside a parcel we should have only one type of pixels that represent the
    respective crop
    If the thematic raster is the result of a behaviour analysis, all the pixels
    inside a parcel should behave in the same way during a period of time.
    The FOI assessment is based on the analysis made on the presence and
    distribution of different types of pixels inside the FOI.

    Args:
        vector_file (str): The parcels poligons in .shp file format or
            database table name without .shp ending.
        raster_file (str): The raster file <...>.
        yaml_file: YAML file that holds the classes of thematic raster file.
        pre_min_het: Minimum thresholds for heterogeneity checks.
        pre_max_het: Maximum thresholds for heterogeneity checks.
        area_threshold: Minimum area for clusters selection.

    Returns:
        bool: True if successful, False otherwise.
