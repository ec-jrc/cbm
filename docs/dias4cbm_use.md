# JRC CbM for decisions on eligibility

## CbM frontend for decisions  
In this section of the [JRC Checks by Monitoring (CbM) DOCUMENTATION](dias4cbm_intro.md) we describe the frontend tools for final users to support reporting tasks and decisions on the eligibility of the declared parcels in the context of the common agricultural policy (CAP) schemes. In this page you find the links to the relevant documentation and demo for the use of the data generated by the JRC CbM system. An introduction to the JRC CbM system is provided in the [OVERVIEW OF THE JRC CbM SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE PAGES](dias4cbm_architecture.md). The interface for decision makers is based on the outputs of the backend of the system documented in the [BACKEND PAGES](dias4cbm_setup.md), and on the tools developed by the analysts that are documented on the [DATA ANALYSIS PAGES](dias4cbm_analysis.md).

## Goals
The main functions of the JRC CbM frontend for final users are:  
* provide a simple interface and a set of tools for decision makers with limited technical background in coding and remote sensing  
* ensure full reproducibility of decisions  
* build out of augmented application logic
