# Image chips

**Using RESTful services to get parcel time series as image chips**

Please read up on the [generic characteristics of the RESTful service](https://jrc-cbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_ts.html) before using the queries described here.

**WARNING**: The query described here is **resource intensive**. It starts a complex task that involves communication between docker containers and parallel execution on several DIAS VMs. The following limitations apply:

* Chip extraction is for Level-1C (L1C) and Level-2A (L2A) Sentinel-2. L2A is not available everywhere, but generally in the CbM onboarding Member States and those in other pilots (e.g. SEN4CAP, EOSC-EAP) where CREODIAS was used. L1C is available globally.

* Selection is by date range. The current limit per request is 24 chips. No cloud filtering is applied. Shorten the time window if it leads to > 24 chips being selected (error output is still rudimentary).

* The service applies a simple rule to exclude duplicate chips for the same date (e.g. in tile overlaps). However, a location may be in a multiple orbit overlap, which will generate denser time series than the usual 5 day repeat cycle of the A and B sensors. Thus, you may need to shorten the time window in order not to exceed the 24 chip limit.

* The server has a simple caching mechanism. If you run the query again, with a larger time window, it will only generate the new chips, taking the rest from cache. This should be used to create longer time series.

* The cache is flushed regularly, typically at midnight (CET).

* **Do not refresh the link** if it is still running, as it will start a new selection process and currently screws up the sequence.

**NOTE**: The use of these RESTful queries on JRC RESTful example is meant for occassional use and testing. If you have a use case that requires many chip generations, please contact us for alternative methods.

All requests are logged, using your internet address (IP). Furthermore, the caching is based on a combination of your IP and query parameters. We regularly check the cache and will contact you in case we detect excessive use.

returns

A JSON dictionary with date labels and relative URLs to cached GeoTIFFs.

You need a client script to transfer the GeoTIFFs and run analysis on it.


## Example client code.

The code example builds on the [client code of the basic RESTful services](https://jrc-cbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_ts.html), and integrates some more advanced processing concepts that help build up to more advanced logic in the next steps.

First, we locate a parcel by location, as before, but now use the geometry that is (optionally) returned by *parcelByLocation* to refine the positioning of the chip selection. This introduces some basic feature geometry handling that is possible with the GDAL python libraries, including geometry creation for JSON, reprojection and centroid extraction. For the centroid position, the *rawChipByLocation* is launched to retrieve the SCL band for the Sentinel-2 Level-2A data. SCL is produced in the atmospheric correction step of SEN2COR, and contains mask values that link to the Scene CLassification. These mask values are useful to determine whether a pixel (in the parcel) is cloud free.

*rawChipByLocation* first stages the selections, as GeoTIFFs, in the user cache on the server and then returns a JSON dictionary with the file locations. This information is then used to download the GeoTIFFs to local disk. Finally, we iterate through the list of downloaded GeoTIFFs and extract the histogram for the parcel pixels.

```
i.e., for each image set, the histogram (a dictionary) shows how many of the 187 pixels included in the parcel (at 20 m resolution) are in each SCL class. The SCL class keys have the following meaning:

(Courtesy of Csaba Wirnhardt, JRC)

thus, only 3 out of the 11 image in June 2018 are cloud free. One has mixed values, and 7 are completely cloud covered.

You can now decide to go pick up the relevant bands for the 4 cloud free acquisitions. This can, in principle, be done with *rawChipByLocation* but that is not a very efficient procedure, because that query does not benefit well from parallel processing.
