## Technical documentation of the JRC CbM for the CAP

These pages are the technical documentation of the [JRC CbM CODE REPOSITORY](https://github.com/ec-jrc/cbm).  
An introduction to the project, with an overview of its architecture and scope, is provided in the [JRC CbM GENERAL DOCUMENTATION](dias4cbm_intro.md).  

The code and documentation of the main components of the JRC CbM are organized per tasks and grouped in three main categories: set up of the infrastructure (backend), make data available to users (frontend), apply the functionalities (data analytics - final users).  
The **backend** component is introduced in the [BACKEND DOCUMENTATION](dias4cbm_setup.md).  
The **frontend** component is introduced in the [FRONTEND DOCUMENTATION](dias4cbm_analysis.md).
The **data analytics** component is introduced in the [DATA ANALYTICS DOCUMENTATION](dias4cbm_use.md).
