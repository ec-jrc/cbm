# NDVI in JRC CbM

* NDVI is correlated to B4 and B4 (it is calculated from them)
* It is one value instead of two
* It is easy to interpret
* It is familiar to most of the analysts

- If we think that it is redundant, we should not calculate it a posteriori
- If it is relevant, it makes sense to correct the exact value
- Derived avg is similar but not the same as the calculated one (depends how homogeneous it is?)
- Stdev not reliable
- For ML probably irrelevant, relevant for visual interpretation
- Difference between derived mean and median demonstrates the differences (see the graph produced)
