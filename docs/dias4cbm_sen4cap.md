# JRC CbM and SEN4CAP

The JRC DIAS for CAP activities is different from the European Space Agency (ESA) [SEN4CAP](http://esa-sen4cap.org/) project. SEN4CAP has a similar aim (providing European and national stakeholders of the CAP with validated algorithms, products, workflows and best practices for agriculture monitoring relevant for the management of the CAP) but there are important divergencies between the modular JRC CbM DIAS set up and the SEN4CAP approach. The key difference is the modularity, i.e. JRC CbM DIAS users can decide which modules are essential in their use context and configure those to suit their needs. JRC CbM modules are NOT tailored to generate crop map products. In fact, the philosophy behind CbM is that PAs already have the best possible crop map as soon as the GSAA parcel declarations are filed. The traffic light approach in CbM prescribes that methods are needed to quickly shift through these declarations to confirm these against the relevant schemes with evidences derived from the Sentinel CARD (switch to green). The clear aim is the reduction of the information to handle and verify, i.e. focus effort on those cases for which further evidence is required, either from additional CARD observations in time or from other sources (e.g. geotagged imagery, orthophotos). A modular set up that supports a wide range of expandable, analytical tools is best suited for such a dynamic, automated evaluation framework.
